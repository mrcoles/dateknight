Project

*   deal with various sources having more/different ones than others
*   consider re-order stuff closer to how MomentJS does it https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/ (also a script similar to analyze.js to order all lang configurations in a consistent way)
*   support the `lang.example`
*   add some others, like ruby, go, etc.
*   favicon
*   deep linking (hash or url pushstate)


Tooling

*   DONE: add scss - https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc
*   lol, get proper node-sass when updated, https://github.com/sass/node-sass/issues/2139

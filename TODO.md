TODO
====

*   allow specific langs to introduce a new format id, maybe namespaced, e.g., something like "momentjs:Y"
*   more langs: ruby, go, ...

*   consider re-ordering stuff closer to how MomentJS does it https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/ (also a script similar to analyze.js to order all lang configurations in a consistent way)
*   maybe more clearly identify lang and library separately for each existing "lang"
*   favicon
*   support deep linking (hash or URL pushstate)
